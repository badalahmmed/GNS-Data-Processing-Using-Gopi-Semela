# GNS-Data-Processing-Using-Gopi-Semela
GNS data preprocessing using Gopi Semela involves converting RINEX files, extracting dual-frequency observables, removing cycle slips, calculating satellite geometry, and deriving slant TEC. It also applies mapping functions to obtain vertical TEC for ionospheric analysis.
